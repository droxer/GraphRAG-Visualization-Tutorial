This entity is not just a mere specter but a symbol deeply intertwined with themes of reflection, memory, and regret. It is tasked with showing Scrooge scenes from his past to highlight the impact of his actions and the importance of personal growth. Through these vivid recollections, the Ghost of Christmas Past encourages Scrooge to reflect on his life, emphasizing moments that have shaped him into the person he has become. Notably, one of the methods it employs to evoke these memories is through music played by Scrooge's niece, adding a unique sensory layer to its interactions with Scrooge.
